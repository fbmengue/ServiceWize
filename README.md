 #Code Refactoring
Introduction
This document provides information about the refactoring of a web application from its original implementation using HTML, PHP, MySQL, CSS, and jQuery to a new version using the latest technology stack, including Angular framework for the frontend and REST API with .NET, Entity Framework, and SQL Server.

#Overview
The original application was built using traditional web technologies and lacked the necessary features and scalability to meet modern-day requirements. Therefore, a decision was made to refactor the application to a more robust and scalable solution that can handle the demands of modern web applications.

The new architecture utilizes the Angular framework for the frontend, providing a more dynamic and interactive user experience. The backend was built using the .NET framework, making use of the Entity Framework to manage the database, and SQL Server as the database management system. The use of REST API allows for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

#Benefits
The refactoring of the application has brought many benefits, including:

Improved performance and scalability
Better security and data protection
Enhanced user experience through the use of Angular framework
Improved maintainability and extendibility through the use of modern architecture
Better integration with other systems through the use of REST API

#Conclusion
The refactoring of the application has brought many improvements and has set the stage for future growth and development. The new technology stack provides a more robust and scalable solution, allowing for improved performance and user experience. The use of modern technologies such as Angular framework and REST API has opened up new opportunities for integration and customization, allowing for future growth and development of the application.
